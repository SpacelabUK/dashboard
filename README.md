# Dashboard

The initial dashboard for the data collected from the workspace consultancy.

# Building
Run `mvn package` to build the war file which is then deployed to a tomcat instance.

# Additional notes
The server side code base is slowly being deprecated in favour of propulsion. At that point
the frontend should be reshaped into a much simpler package just containing html and javascript.
